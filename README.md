# GDevelop

## Game Development using GDevelop

### Each Directory is a Game

GDevelop is a 'no-code' platform, which compiles for Android, Web, Windows, macOS, linux and iOS.

Currently learning the system and all 'games' for now are just that, learning exercises.

Ultimate goal is the Drinking Game, the brain-child of Robin Kluis.
